This uses aoi.js (the code in between $djsEval is actually discordJS so people using discordJS can use it too)

# To Use
- In the code, it states where you have to put your server's IP and Port, you insert the ip and port there.
- Then run -serverstatus command in any channel, it will start sending the updates.

NOTE - It will stop updating the embed if server restarts!
